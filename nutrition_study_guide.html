        "The scientific method follows these systematic steps: (1) Observe patterns and phenomena, (2) Review prior knowledge and literature, then make hypotheses based on observations, (3) Conduct controlled experiments designed to test the hypothesis, (4) Analyze data and observations collected from experiments, (5) Draw conclusions based on the data analysis, and (6) Share findings with the scientific community to get peer feedback and allow for replication of studies.",
        "The purpose of the scientific method is to provide a standardized, objective approach to understanding the natural world and testing theories. In nutrition science specifically, it allows researchers to systematically study how nutrients affect human health, establish cause-and-effect relationships, and develop evidence-based dietary recommendations. This methodology helps eliminate bias, ensures reproducibility, and builds reliable knowledge about nutrition and health.",
        "Peer reviewers - typically other scientists and experts in the same field - review research work before it's published. This peer review process involves independent evaluation of the study's methodology, data analysis, conclusions, and scientific merit. Only after passing this rigorous review process can research be published in reputable scientific journals, ensuring quality and reliability of published nutrition research."

      ],
      "answers": [
        "The three macronutrients are: (1) CARBOHYDRATES - provide 4 kilocalories per gram, (2) PROTEINS - provide 4 kilocalories per gram, and (3) FATS (LIPIDS) - provide 9 kilocalories per gram. Note that alcohol, while not a nutrient, provides 7 kilocalories per gram. These macronutrients are called 'macro' because the body needs them in large amounts (grams) compared to micronutrients (vitamins and minerals needed in milligrams or micrograms).",
        "A nutrient is considered essential if it meets ALL THREE criteria: (1) A specific biological function in the body has been identified for that nutrient, (2) That specific function becomes impaired when the nutrient is removed from the diet, and (3) The same function is restored when the nutrient is added back to the diet. The essential nutrients include: 9 essential amino acids (from proteins), 2 essential fatty acids (omega-3 ALA and omega-6 LA), all 13 vitamins (A, D, E, K, C, and 8 B vitamins), approximately 15 essential minerals (including calcium, iron, zinc, etc.), and water.",
        "Energy density is calculated using the formula: Energy Density = Total Calories ÷ Weight of Food (in grams). To find total calories, multiply grams of each macronutrient by their caloric values: carbohydrates × 4 kcal/g + proteins × 4 kcal/g + fats × 9 kcal/g = total calories. Then divide by the food's weight in grams. Foods with higher energy density provide more calories per gram (like nuts, oils), while foods with lower energy density provide fewer calories per gram (like fruits, vegetables with high water content)."
