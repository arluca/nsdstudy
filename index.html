            "The three macronutrients are: (1) CARBOHYDRATES - provide 4 kilocalories per gram, (2) PROTEINS - provide 4 kilocalories per gram, and (3) FATS (LIPIDS) - provide 9 kilocalories per gram. Note that alcohol, while not a nutrient, provides 7 kilocalories per gram. These macronutrients are called 'macro' because the body needs them in large amounts (grams) compared to micronutrients (vitamins and minerals needed in milligrams or micrograms).",

            "A complex carbohydrate is a large molecule made up of many glucose units linked together in long chains. STRUCTURE: Complex carbohydrates include starch and fiber. STARCH has glucose units connected by ALPHA bonds that digestive enzymes can break (amylose is unbranched, amylopectin is branched). FIBER has glucose units connected by BETA bonds that human enzymes cannot break. Complex carbs provide sustained energy because they take time to digest and break down into individual glucose molecules, unlike simple sugars that are rapidly absorbed.",
            "High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a liquid sweetener containing about 55% fructose and 45% glucose (similar to sucrose which is 50/50). WHY IT'S CONSIDERED PROBLEMATIC: (1) Very cheap to produce, leading to overuse in processed foods, (2) Americans consume about 60 pounds per year, (3) Fructose metabolism differs from glucose - it bypasses normal blood sugar regulation, (4) Research suggests it may promote fat storage more than regular sugar, (5) Linked to increased visceral (belly) fat accumulation. However, current research shows HFCS is metabolically similar to regular sugar - the main issue is overconsumption of any added sugars.",
            "Fiber is the indigestible part of plant foods, consisting of carbohydrates with BETA bonds that human enzymes cannot break. IN THE GI TRACT: Fiber passes through the stomach and small intestine largely intact since we lack enzymes to digest it. In the large intestine (colon), beneficial bacteria ferment some types of fiber, producing beneficial compounds like short-chain fatty acids. Fiber adds bulk to stool, helps maintain bowel regularity, slows nutrient absorption (which helps control blood sugar and cholesterol), and provides food for healthy gut bacteria."

          answers: [
            "The difference between fats and oils is their physical state at room temperature, which reflects their chemical composition: FATS are solid at room temperature and contain more SATURATED fatty acids (no double bonds between carbons, allowing molecules to pack tightly together). Examples include butter, lard, coconut oil. OILS are liquid at room temperature and contain more UNSATURATED fatty acids (one or more double bonds creating 'kinks' that prevent tight packing). Examples include olive oil, canola oil, sunflower oil.",
            "OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS are essential polyunsaturated fats with the first double bond located at the third carbon from the omega (methyl) end of the fatty acid chain. They are anti-inflammatory and support heart and brain health. OMEGA-6 FATTY ACIDS are essential polyunsaturated fats with the first double bond at the sixth carbon from the omega end. While essential, they tend to be pro-inflammatory when consumed in excess relative to omega-3s. The modern Western diet contains too much omega-6 (from vegetable oils) relative to omega-3s, creating an inflammatory imbalance.",
            "EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid) and DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid) are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids found primarily in fatty fish, algae, and seafood. ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid) is a shorter-chain omega-3 found in plant sources like flaxseeds, walnuts, and chia seeds. DIFFERENCES: EPA has strong anti-inflammatory effects and supports cardiovascular health; DHA is crucial for brain function, eye health, and nervous system development; ALA can be converted to EPA and DHA but very inefficiently (only 1-10% conversion rate). Therefore, direct consumption of EPA/DHA from fish or algae is more effective than relying on ALA conversion."

            "A vitamin is an organic compound that the body needs in very small amounts (milligrams or micrograms) to help regulate and support chemical reactions and maintain normal physiological functions. Key characteristics: (1) All vitamins are essential nutrients - the body cannot make them in sufficient quantities, (2) They are needed in tiny amounts but have crucial roles, (3) They act as antioxidants, coenzymes, and hormone precursors, (4) Deficiency causes specific diseases, (5) They can be destroyed by heat, light, air, or alkaline conditions, (6) They are organic molecules containing carbon.",

Deficiency leads to osteoporosis, fractures, and poor bone development in children. IRON importance: Essential component of hemoglobin (carries oxygen in blood) and myoglobin (stores oxygen in muscles), part of enzymes involved in energy metabolism, supports immune function. Iron deficiency causes anemia (fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath), and is the most common nutrient deficiency worldwide.",

It includes: eating a variety of foods from all food groups (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, healthy fats), choosing nutrient-dense foods over calorie-dense but nutrient-poor foods, limiting added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium, maintaining appropriate portion sizes, staying hydrated, and considering individual needs based on age, activity level, and health conditions.",
            "Foods high in sodium and saturated fat should be limited because: SODIUM excess increases blood pressure (hypertension), which raises the risk of stroke, heart disease, and kidney disease. The body only needs about 500mg sodium daily, but Americans consume 2300-3400mg on average. SATURATED FAT raises LDL ('bad') cholesterol levels in the blood, contributing to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries), which increases risk of heart disease and stroke.",
            "Foods highest in SODIUM include: processed meats (bacon, deli meats, sausages), canned soups and broths, frozen meals, restaurant foods, chips and salty snacks, cheese, bread and baked goods, condiments and sauces. Foods highest in SATURATED FAT include: fatty cuts of meat (ribeye, ground beef), full-fat dairy products (butter, whole milk, cheese, ice cream), coconut and palm oils, fried foods, baked goods made with solid fats, and processed snack foods.",
            "Psychological factors that encourage eating include: SENSORY factors (appealing taste, smell, texture, color, temperature), SOCIAL factors (eating with others, cultural traditions, learned behaviors from family), EMOTIONAL factors (stress eating, comfort foods, eating when bored or sad), ENVIRONMENTAL cues (food advertising, seeing food, accessibility), LEARNED ASSOCIATIONS (linking certain foods with celebrations or rewards), and APPETITE (external cues that stimulate eating even without hunger)."

            "COMPLETE PROTEINS contain all 9 essential amino acids in adequate proportions that the human body needs but cannot produce on its own. These proteins can support protein synthesis and growth without needing to be combined with other protein sources. Examples include: animal proteins (meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy), quinoa, soy products (tofu, tempeh), buckwheat, hemp seeds, and chia seeds. INCOMPLETE PROTEINS are missing one or more of the essential amino acids or contain them in insufficient amounts. Examples include most plant proteins: beans and legumes (low in methionine), grains (low in lysine), nuts and seeds (variable deficiencies). However, incomplete proteins can be combined throughout the day to create a complete amino acid profile - this is called protein complementation."

          answers: [
            "Essential amino acids are important because: (1) The body cannot produce them in sufficient quantities, so they must be obtained from food, (2) All 9 essential amino acids must be present simultaneously for protein synthesis to occur - if even one is missing, protein synthesis stops, (3) They serve as building blocks for creating all body proteins including enzymes, hormones, antibodies, structural proteins, and transport proteins, (4) They support growth, tissue repair, immune function, and metabolism.",
            "Protein synthesis is the process by which cells create proteins from amino acids according to instructions in DNA. PROCESS: (1) TRANSCRIPTION - DNA instructions are copied to messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus, (2) TRANSLATION - mRNA moves to ribosomes where it's 'read' in groups of three nucleotides (codons), (3) Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, (4) Transfer RNA (tRNA) brings the correct amino acids to the ribosome, (5) Amino acids are linked together in the correct sequence to form a polypeptide chain, (6) The chain folds into its functional 3D shape.",
            "Protein shape is crucial because structure determines function - a protein's 3D shape determines what it can do in the body. IMPORTANCE: (1) ENZYME ACTIVITY - enzymes must have the correct shape for their active site to bind substrates, (2) HORMONE FUNCTION - hormones like insulin must have proper shape to bind to receptors, (3) ANTIBODY RECOGNITION - antibodies recognize specific shapes on pathogens, (4) TRANSPORT - hemoglobin's shape allows it to carry oxygen, (5) STRUCTURE - collagen's triple helix provides strength to connective tissue.",
            "Genetic disorders can impact proteins in several ways: (1) GENETIC MUTATIONS can change the amino acid sequence, altering protein shape and function (example: sickle cell anemia creates abnormal hemoglobin), (2) MISSING ENZYMES - genetic defects can prevent production of specific enzymes (example: Phenylketonuria/PKU - cannot make enzyme to metabolize phenylalanine, leading to toxic buildup and mental retardation if untreated), (3) ALTERED PROTEIN STRUCTURE - mutations can create unstable or non-functional proteins."

Insulin promotes glucose uptake by cells, glucose storage as glycogen, fat storage, and protein synthesis. It lowers blood glucose levels. GLUCAGON - released when blood glucose is LOW (between meals, during fasting). Glucagon promotes breakdown of stored glycogen to release glucose, stimulates gluconeogenesis (making glucose from other sources), and promotes fat breakdown for energy.
